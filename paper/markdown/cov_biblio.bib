@article{Fritz2012,
abstract = {The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (American Psychological Association, 2001,2010) calls for the reporting of effect sizes and their confidence intervals. Estimates of effect size are useful for determining the practical or theoretical importance of an effect, the relative contributions of factors, and the power of an analysis. We surveyed articles published in 2009 and 2010 in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, noting the statistical analyses reported and the associated reporting of effect size estimates. Effect sizes were reported for fewer than half of the analyses; no article reported a confidence interval for an effect size. The most often reported analysis was analysis of variance, and almost half of these reports were not accompanied by effect sizes. Partial $\eta$2 was the most commonly reported effect size estimate for analysis of variance. For t tests, 2/3 of the articles did not report an associated effect size estimate; Cohen's d was the most often reported. We provide a straightforward guide to understanding, selecting, calculating, and interpreting effect sizes for many types of data and to methods for calculating effect size confidence intervals and power analysis. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Psychological Association.},

@article{Brant1990,
abstract = {The proportional odds model for ordinal logistic regression provides a useful extension of the binary logistic model to situations where the response variable takes on values in a set of ordered categories. The model may be represented by a series of logistic regressions for dependent binary variables, with common regression parameters reflecting the proportional odds assumption. Key to the valid application of the model is the assessment of the proportionality assumption. An approach is described arising from comparisons of the separate (correlated) fits to the binary logistic models underlying the overall model. Based on asymptotic distributional results, formal goodness-of-fit measures are constructed to supplement informal comparisons of the different fits. A number of proposals, including application of bootstrap simulation, are discussed and illustrated with a data example.},
