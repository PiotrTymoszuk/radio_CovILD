The cluster assignment for the outcome variables  at the 180-day follow-up visit (V3, persistent symptoms, functional lung impairment, mild lung CT abnormalities [severity score $\leq$ 5] and moderate-to-severe lung CT abnormalities [severity score > 5]) was predicted by k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) label propagation procedure.

The procedure involved clustering of the observations with self-organizing maps (SOM, 4 $\times$ 4 hexagonal grid, distances: SMD: simple matching distance, Jaccard, Dice or cosine) followed by clustering of the SOM nodes (algorithms: HCl ward.D2: hierarchical clustering with Ward.D2 method, K-means, PAM: partitioning around medoids, distance: euclidean).

The impact of a particular clustering variable was determined by comparing the 'explained' clustering variance (between-cluster to total sum-of-squares ratio) between the initial cluster structure and the structure wit random re-shuffling of the variable ('noising'). Differences in the clustering variances for the most influential clustering variables ($\Delta$ clustering variance > 0) are presented in the plot.

Odds ratio (OR) significance was determined by Wald Z test and corrected for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. OR wit 95$%$ confidence intervals are presented in Forest plots.
